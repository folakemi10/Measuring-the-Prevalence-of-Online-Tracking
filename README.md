# Measuring-the-Prevalence-of-Online-Tracking
In this project, I conducted measurements to analyze the impact of using ad blocking extensions on Tranco 100 websites with advertisements 

## Details
I've already visited Tranco 100 websites in the “vanilla mode” and “ad blocking mode” and the associated network data are recorded in the vanilla_data and adblock_data folders. To see my results for Tasks 2-5 you can follow the steps below

## step 1: 
Open Tracker_Parser.ipynb using Jupyter notebook

## step 2:
Run the first cell and you will see all the plots for both the vanilla and adblock mode for all the tasks

## step 3:
Run the Second cell and you will see the top 10 domains for each task along with the frequencies associated with them
